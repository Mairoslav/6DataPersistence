// MARK: 3. File System Quiz, iOS file system vs MacOS file system.
// Thinking about the iOS FIle System
// Given what we just learned about the iOS file sytem, think of a few ways that this system is similar to the Mac OS file sytem, and a few ways that it is different. List them out in this box below. Hint: think about how Mac's Finder works.

/*
 Here are some similarities between the two file systems (iOS and OSX):

 TODO: Similarities:
 -They are both Unix based. If you don’t know what this means, never mind. ;-)
 -Both have special folders called Documents or Library for each user (OSX) or App (iOS)
 -Both may sync content with the cloud by using iCloud

 TODO: Differences:
 -While the security (who can access which folders) on OSX is relatively lax, on iOS it is extremely strict.
 -The absolute paths for key folders in OSX, such as your home folder, don’t change every time you boot your Mac. On iOS, on the other hand, the absolute path for key folders will change.
