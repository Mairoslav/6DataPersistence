// MARK: 4. Setting Up the Stack in Mooskine
// 00:00 Ok let's set up the Core Data stack in Mooskine, so that we can interact with Note and Notebook instances. We'll continue working with our Mooskine project from where we left off.

// 00:22 First we need to decide where to put our stack setup code. We want to set up this stack when our application first starts up, but it's better if we do not clutter (overfill) the App Delegate. So let's create a class to encapsulate the stack setup, and its functionality. We'll call it DataController. So let's do it:

// 0:42 Right click on the folder Model Group / Choose New File / Swift File / Next / name file 'DataController.swift' / click create

// 01:01 Now continue with comments in 'DataController.swift'
