// MARK: 2. Refactoring
// 00:00 Our app is fully functional but there are still some improvements we can make in the code. The name for this practice is refactoring. Refactoring is to coding like editing is to writing. When the author sits down to write a first draft, they may find it helpful to just let the thoughts flow, without worrying about whether the grammar and structure are perfect so that noting blocks their creativity.
// 00:29 But once the basic form is there, the author can switch into editing mode. An editor's goal is to improve  a text without changing its style or message. The end result is cleaner and often more concise text. Like a writer's first draft, our code can benefit from some thoughtful editing. A few tweaks can make our code easier to read and maintain, and less prone to error.
// 01:00 For example we can take some complex pieces and make them simpler. Any future developer who touches our code will be better off including ourselves. So let's refactor Mooskine.
