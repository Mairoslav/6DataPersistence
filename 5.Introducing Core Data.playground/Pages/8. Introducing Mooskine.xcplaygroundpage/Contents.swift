// MARK: 8. Introducing Mooskine
// 00:00 This is Moleskine. You know like Hemingway and Van Gogh's legendary Moleskin notebooks, but now with more cowbell. Mooskine works a lot like the iOS notes app. It contains a notebook, and each notebook contains a number of notes. Within each notebook you see a preview of every note it contains. You can add notes, see a full note by tapping on it, and edit it in the details screen.

// 00:32 However if we exit the app, force terminate it, and reopen it, our notes are gone.

// To fix this we'll first need to grab the code. Follow the steps on the next page to download the Mooskine source code.
