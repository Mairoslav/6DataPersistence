// MARK: 4. More than Persistence
// MARK: Core Data is a framework for managing an app's data layer.
// This includes the app's model (the data's structure and relationships), as well as code for changing the model and updating the UI when the model changes.

// When we say that Core Data is a ***framework***, we mean that it is a library—or bundle of code—that can be included in an app and used to perform specific tasks. In the case of the Core Data framework, those tasks are model creation and data layer management.

// ***framework*** https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFrameworks/Concepts/WhatAreFrameworks.html

// You can begin using Core Data in your apps before you even get close to adding persistence—and will find it easier to add persistence later if you do!

// MARK: Core Data != Persistence
// Persistence is just one aspect of data layer management. But it is an important one!

// So now that we've cleared up the common misconception, let's explore why we might want to use Core Data for persistence.
