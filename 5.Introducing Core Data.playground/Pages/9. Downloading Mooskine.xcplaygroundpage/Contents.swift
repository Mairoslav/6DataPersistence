// MARK: 9. Downloading Mooskine
// Downloading Mooskine
// It's time to download the Mooskine source code! There are two options: to download the files as a zip, or clone the Github repository.

// MARK: Option 1: Download the zip
/*
 The Mooskine source code is included in the iOS Persistence and Core Data zip file. You may have already opened this file if you've worked with previous lessons in this course.

 Double-click the zip file to unzip it, and navigate into the Mooskine > Mooskine-starter directory, where you'll find Mooskine.xcodeproj. Double-click this file to open it.
 */

// MARK: Option 2: Clone the Github repo
/*
 If you are comfortable with git and prefer to clone the repo manually, you can use the following commands in Terminal:

 git clone https://github.com/udacity/ios-nd-persistence.git
 cd ios-nd-persistence/Mooskine/Mooskine-starter/
 open Mooskine.xcodeproj/
    
 If you are not yet comfortable with git and Github, don't worry! You wonâ€™t need to them to follow along with the course. You can simply work with the downloaded zip. However, if you would like to become proficient with git, we recommend our free Version Control with Git and GitHub & Collaboration courses.

 With Mooskine.xcodeproj open in Xcode, you're good to go!
