// MARK: 6. Pick Your Pitch
// All right so it's trime for yuou to try flying solo with UserDefaults by implementing them on this record app called PickYourPitch.
// We can see that the 1st page allows us to record a sound file ... now speaking so that my voice is recorded ... and that the 2nd page allows us to play back that sound file as well as adjust the pitch with the slider.

// 00:27 But we can see that when we close the app and restart it, the pitch information that we set is gone. Test again, Instead of the slider being off to the left where we left it, it's now back in the middle in its default position.

// 00:41 Your challenge is to make the position of the slider persistent. Think of it as a simple version of a user preference. If you're making an app for playing podcasts, you might have a settings page where the user sets their preferred playback speed, and users often expect apps to remember that kind of preference. So check out the following instructions and see if you can make this recording app persistent.
