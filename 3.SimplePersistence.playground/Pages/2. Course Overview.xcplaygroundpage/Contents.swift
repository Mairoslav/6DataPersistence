// MARK: 2. Course Overview
// 00:00 What actually persistence means? Persistence is saving data to a place where it can be re-accessed and retrieved upon restart of the device or app.

// 00:18 This can mean using memory on your device, or saving data to remote servers.

// Persistence is necessary for any app that wants to store data in long term and keep in available to the user. In this lesson/s we'll cover:

// How persistence works, why it is needed, what options are available for creating persistent iOS apps, and what the most (options) important are.

// MARK: Lesson 1: Simple Persistence: NSUserDefaults
// 1. 01:04 We'll start with Simple Persistence UserDefaults
// MARK: Lesson 2: iOS File System and Sandboxing
// 2. iOS File System & Sandboxing
// MARK: Lesson 3: Introducing Core Data
// 3. Comprehensive Persistence Core Data (Part 1). Most important option for Data Persistence. We'll talk about pieces of the Core Data Stack, how to create a data model, how to make objects from that model.
// MARK: Lesson 4: The Core Data Stack
// 4. Comprehensive Persistence Core Data (Part 2). See how it actually process our changes, what happens behind the scenes/under the hood. Most importantly, what core data does provide beyond persistency. Also learn how to display core data objects in tables and collection views.
// MARK: Lesson 5: Simpler Code with Core Data
// MARK: Lesson 6: Rounding Out Core Data
// 5. Important extras. Deep deeper and find out how to search and filter objects, how to migrate our data model, which is vital to know before uploading an app to the app store.

// Let's start by finding out how the dog plans to save Marty's algoritm/message by using UserDefaults.
