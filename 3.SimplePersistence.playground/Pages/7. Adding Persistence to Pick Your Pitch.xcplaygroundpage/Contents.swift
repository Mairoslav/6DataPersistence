 MARK: 7. Adding Persistence to Pick Your Pitch
 Your goal: Ensure that the slider maintains its position from one run to another.

 The basic version of the app is in the PickYourPitch-NoPersistence directory of the iOS Persistence course projects repo, so download the repo if you haven't already.

 TODO: Step 1. Download the basic version of Pick Your Pitch, try it out, and look around the code a bit.

 One question that will come up over and over again in this course is:
 
    // Where in the code should we add statements that store and retrieve data? For this app, it seems safe to say the statements that persist the slider’s state will be in the 'PlaySoundsViewController'.
 
    // But which methods? Or do we need to add new methods? While there is no single right answer to that question, there are a few methods that would work better than others.
 
 TODO: Step 2. Decide in which methods of 'PlaySoundsViewController' you would:

    // a) Save the slider position
    // b) Retrieve the slider position

The UI slider view, whose outlet in the code is called sliderView, maintains a float property called “value”.

 TODO: Step 3. Figure out which methods of UserDefaults you can use to save and retrieve this float.
 
    // Which methods of UserDefaults you can use to a) save and b) retrieve this Float.

 TODO: Step 4. Implement the code and test your app.

 Remember: To launch your app as if it’s launching for the very first time ever, you will need to Reset your simulator’s Content and Settings from the Simulator menu by clicking Simulator/ Reset Content and Settings.

 Once you're done, continue forward!
