// MARK: Intro
// 00:00 In the not so distant past: Mary was about to send important message, however she was interrupted by pizza, so did postpone sending out message. However when she came back the phone did run out of the battery. Her draft was lost.

// To keep the drafts ... the iOS Persistence is used.

// Note: If this was the current iOS Messages app, the draft of the message that Marty wrote out would actually be saved and still be there upon app restart, since the current iOS Messages app uses persistence. A couple years ago though, message drafts weren't persisted in Messages, and like in the above scenario, sometimes important message drafts could be lost!
