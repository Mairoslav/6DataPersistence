// MARK: 3. UserDefaults Intro
/*
 UserDefaults: a Dictionary that periodically saves its contents to your device’s permanent storage (SSD).

 - Great for storing user preferences and other simple things.
 - Saves data in a plist file (property list file).
 - Can only store the following data types: Data, String, Number, Date, Array, and Dictionary.
 - When storing (writing) the file or accessing (reading) the file, UserDefaults does it all at once, possibly creating long/unnecessary I/O time.
 - It’s a good idea to keep UserDefaults under 1MB.
